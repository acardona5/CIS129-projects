 print('Once upon a time...\nThere was a chicken gazing over a river. The river was wide and seemed too daunting to cross by\
 flight. Yet over that river, the most enchanting tall glass covered medow glistening in the sun awaited. Whilst longing\
to be on the other side of the river a tiny fairy with iridescent wings fluttering apeared above, manifested from the wishes\
 of the chicken. In a blink of an eye the fairy turned the river into a solid road for the chicken to cross. This is how\
the chicken crossed the road.\n The End.')
